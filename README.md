# Curriculum and Motivation

Setting the scope for the "Summer of Data". Progress will be documented within the repos of this organization. 

## Motivation
I want to fully transition towards a career in data science and machine learning, and while I have some education in this area, and will likely be joining a MS in CS within the next year, I wanted to start this summer. MITx's Micromasters is appealing and will offer  some credits for graduate school, but some reviews note how it is more academic than industry focused. Thus, [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-data-analytics), which is significantly less rigorous but appears to fit needs that would round out my development. Also, it has quite a different pace and structure from the rigid, structured coursework and deadlines of MITx's program. 

Finally, I anticipate participating once again in [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a computational neuroscience summer school. This year, it also has a targeted Deep Learning program, adjacent to the main material in compneuro. 

"Data of Summer" will be my main focus for the next ~6 months (unless I can finish the google certificate or find an actual DS-specific job first) - but I intend to keep contributing to ongoing research at my current position within Orthogonal Research and Education Lab. With exception to one or two other research programs I may hear back from within the next few weeks, and my existing day job in it/dev, this will be my target.
