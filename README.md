# Update: November 2021
Well, just to make a public comment on this ORG & Repo, a whole lot happened this summer! Just as I was gearing up in this plan of attack for the summer, I got 3-4 amazing opportunities that came up. I got a new job doing research in the HealthTech field; I was solicited to join an amazing research-mapping startup; I got a grant to support research efforts in the UK for some months; and at the end of the summer, I found out I was accepted to a NSF graduate research fellowship. This was a great project plan and layout, and who knows if I'll go back to it later. I'm really hoping to get into graduate school for the next summer, but come the turn of the year, I may invest heavily again in fleshing out some of these related skills. Cheers!

# Curriculum and Motivation

Setting the scope for the "Summer of Data". Progress will be documented within the repos of this organization. 

## Motivation
I want to fully transition towards a career in data science and machine learning, and while I have some education in this area, and will likely be joining a MS in CS within the next year, I wanted to start this summer. MITx's Micromasters is appealing and will offer  some credits for graduate school, but some reviews note how it is more academic than industry focused. Thus, [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-data-analytics), which is significantly less rigorous but appears to fit needs that would round out my development. Also, it has quite a different pace and structure from the rigid, structured coursework and deadlines of MITx's program. 

Finally, I anticipate participating once again in [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a computational neuroscience summer school. This year, it also has a targeted Deep Learning program, adjacent to the main material in compneuro. 

"Data of Summer" will be my main focus for the next ~6 months (unless I can finish the google certificate or find an actual DS-specific job first) - but I intend to keep contributing to ongoing research at my current position within Orthogonal Research and Education Lab. With exception to one or two other research programs I may hear back from within the next few weeks, and my existing day job in it/dev, this will be my target.
